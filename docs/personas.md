## Namlit (31)

Somewhat technical knowledge. Cycles happily

- Wants to host his own pod and use that
- Maybe even host an own instance
- Would like to download points on his tour route to GPX
- Wants to submit his mom's garden as well as his home
- Would like to access the API to build stuff
- Would like a frontend without JS
- If app, make it available on FDroid or APK

## Mathilda (23)

Just discovered cycling
2 weeks; with 2 friends

- Do the people accept three persons?
- Do we sleep inside or outside?
- Safe bike storage?
- (Do you want to have con??? with us?) _(maybe contact?)_
- Can I take a shower?
- Access easy with smartphone
- Functional prettiness | maybe darkmode?
- Easy finding hosts along the route -> map function -> "saves" last location so i do not have to search on the map so long
- Want to feel safe -> feedback function? proof of validity?

Need to be aware that it is not a free hotel

## Bertha (73)

Only speaks french.

My grandkid Dan told me about this page and I have a garden where I would like to let people sleep. I have never done this myself, so I won't think about stuff like people needing to poop (I don't want strangers to immediately get into my house!)

What I want to do:

- Create an account
  - I have no idea about technology so I may have an email. Can I just give you my phone if I forgot my password? SMS
  - Please don't make me select a pod, just username and password
- Place a garden where I live
  - can I get closer to my location by IP
  - maybe reverse lookup (address -> GPS)
- Tell people it's a garden and I only speak french (i18n?)
- If someone writes me over the page can I get a notification? (is there an app with push notifications?)
- I don't want my number on this dangerous internet
  - can it just show when I accept?
- I'm going on vacation so I want to block that time
  - also if I accept someone, maybe show I can't take people in?
