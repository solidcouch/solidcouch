# Get a Solid Pod

Solid Pod is where your SolidCouch data are stored. You can register with a Pod provider, or host your own.

## Get a Pod from a Solid Pod provider

There are various [Solid Pod providers](https://solidproject.org/get_a_pod) you can choose from. However, not all providers are currently compatible with SolidCouch.

You can go to your [SolidCouch instance](./instances.md), click `Sign in` > `Don't have a Solid Pod yet?`, and select one of the options.

## Host your WebId on your domain

If you own a **domain name**, you can have your [WebID](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol#webid) on your domain. This gives you more control over your Solid identity.

Choose the option _"Use my existing WebID to access my Pod"_ with one of these providers:

- solidcommunity.net
- solidweb.me
- solid.redpencil.io
- teamid.live
- pods.solidcommunity.au

To complete the process, you must prove that the WebID on your domain belongs to you. Afterwards, the WebID must point to your Profile Document.

## Host your Solid Pod

You can also **host your Pod**. This will give you full control over your data. However, it's more complicated to set up, and requires maintenance. We recommend [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/communitysolidserver/communitysolidserver#-running-the-server).
