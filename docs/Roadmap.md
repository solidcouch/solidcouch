# Roadmap for sleepy.bike

## Grow and maintain production community at https://sleepy.bike

- maintain server infrastructure (app(s), sleepy bike community pod, index for geosearch, email notifications service, ...)
- maintain social media site(s)
- spread the information about the community

## Create index for geosearch of accommodations

to make search of accommodations scalable

## Create email notifications service

Email notifications service will receive notifications about new items in members' inbox, and send email when appropriate

## Fix design, UI & UX of the app

That's a long way to go...

## Internationalization (i18n) - translate the website and make it available in multiple languages

People should be able to use the website in different languages, and also provide their information in multiple languages

## Extract library for querying data, and make it more efficient

so other people can use it

## Make the community independent of a single list of members (https://community.sleepy.bike)

To remove the single point of failure and control, which central list of members is

## Build app for community management

A less-than-minimal version [already exists](https://github.com/OpenHospitalityNetwork/solid-community-manager), but it's buggy and many functionalities are missing

## Support ESS and Trinpod and other Solid pods

- support ACP access control? (Access Control Policies is alternative way of access control to ACL that is used by ESS)

## Make option to have invite-only community

Some communities want to grow more slowly and be more exclusive

## Make it easy to deploy the app for different communities

- customization of looks and functionality
- good documentation

## ...

This list is work in progress

## Long term: make other community apps that members can use

The goals of these apps are:

- meaningful connections
- reality
- sustainability

Some ideas include:

- collaboration
- founding intentional communities
- unschooling
- ...
