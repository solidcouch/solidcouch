# Internationalization (i18n)

In SolidCouch, there are two areas that can be translated:

1. UI - using [lingui](lingui.dev).
2. Data - using [RDF language tags](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-language-tagged-string), for example `@en` in [turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-turtle/#turtle-literals) syntax.
