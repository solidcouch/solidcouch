Welcome to the sleepy bike community. We're happy to have you. Here you can read why we created it and what our values are. See if it matches and you feel it would fit your way of travelling and connecting.

## What

The sleepy bike community is created for the bicycle touring traveller and their supporters. Those who roam by bike, camp out and stay off grid but also like to connect with others, enjoy some nice hot food and a warm shower along the way. It's decentralised and open source. Our main values are 'transparency, democracy and mutual aid'.

## Why

Because we believe that building a community with Solid as a base gives users more control over their own data, makes it easier to move between possible future other communities, taking your connections with you wherever you migrate to. We aim to be as transparent, democratic and open as we can by sharing what we're doing, where you can find that progress and we're open for everyone to join the conversation on how to move forward.

## How

The use of sleepy bike is very straightforward. It has all the functions to search for hosts, create a profile, send messages and add contacts. The design focuses on function over looks, which means less complicated code and therefore less maintenance and sensitivity to crashing. To find more info about the server Solid, privacy, etc., check out [their website](https://solidproject.org). You can check out the sleepy bike progress at [this GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHospitalityNetwork/sleepy.bike). If you want to join the conversation, you can find us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ohn:matrix.org).

## Who

Sleepy bike was born out of a response to other cyclist platforms who went for profit over people. All our volunteers have their own qualities and experiences in the hospex scene. Some are true tour cyclists, others prefer to host and some just have passion to support this lovely project.

Enjoy the community!`
